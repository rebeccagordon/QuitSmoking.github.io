Do you want to Stop Smoking?

What are the keys to quitting smoking and staying quit? What roles do your mood and your personality play in how you quit smoking? Investigators at Brown University are conducting a research study to test whether a smoking cessation program that includes nicotine replacement therapy, text messaging support, and counseling focused on improving moods and using personal strengths can help smokers quit for good.  Participants receive, at no cost, individual counseling, nicotine replacement therapy and text messaging support.

Call (401) 863-6681 for more information.</p>

										<h3>Naltrexone</h3>
									<p style="text-align:left;">

Naltrexone is a medication that blocks the effects of drugs known as opiates, or narcotics (a class that includes morphine, heroin, or codeine). It competes with these drugs for opioid receptors in the brain. Originally used to treat dependence on opiate drugs, it now has also been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as treatment for alcohol dependence. In addition, naltrexone may be particularly helpful for heavy drinkers who want to quit smoking. Although the precise mechanism of action for naltrexone’s effect is unknown, reports from successfully treated patients suggest the following kinds of effects:

Naltrexone can reduce your urge or desire to drink.
When abstinence is the goal, Naltrexone helps you remain abstinent.
Naltrexone can interfere with your desire to continue drinking more if you slip and have a drink.
										Naltrexone may reduce cravings for cigarettes that occur after drinking alcohol.</p>
								
									<span class="image"><img src="images/patch.png" alt=""></span>
										<h3>Nicotine patch</h3>
										<p style="text-align:left;"> What is the Nicotine patch? It is a small, nicotine-containing patch that adheres to your skin. The Nicotine patch is very thin and controls how fast nicotine passes through the skin into your bloodstream. Unlike the sudden jolts of nicotine delivered by cigarettes, the amount of nicotine you receive remains relatively smooth throughout the 24 period you wear the patch. This helps to reduce the cravings you may have for nicotine.</p>
