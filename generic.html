								<h2>Why is quitting so hard?</h2>
								<p>
Many ex-smokers say quitting was the hardest thing they ever did. Do you feel hooked? You are probably addicted to nicotine. Nicotine is in all tobacco products. Nicotine makes you feel calm and satisfied. At the same time, you feel more alert and focused. The more you smoke, the more nicotine you need to feel good. Soon, you don’t feel “normal” without nicotine. It takes time to break free from nicotine addiction. It may take more than one try to quit for good. So don’t give up too soon. You will feel good again.</p>
								
								<h2>Announce a quit date</h2>
								<p>Announce a quit date to help you end any bad habit, “You want to have at least one person whom you know, if you call that that person, will tell you, ‘Don’t smoke,'” says Christopher Kahler, professor of community health at Brown University. “Particularly if you are going out to parties and family events, if you have somebody who knows what your intention is, that’s a very important thing.”</p>
							<h2>Information about The Rhode Island Tobacco Control Program</h2>
								<p>The Rhode Island Tobacco Control Program works to create changes in social, political, and physical environments to make it more difficult to start and continue using tobacco, make it easier to quit, and make choosing health the easier choice. For more information, visit www.health.ri.gov/tobacco</p>
								<h2>Smoking goes with other things</h2>
								<p>Smoking goes with other things. You may light up when you feel a certain way or do certain things. For example:

Drinking coffee, wine, or beer
Talking on the phone
Driving
Being with other smokers
You may even feel uncomfortable not smoking at times or in places where you usually have a cigarette. These times and places are called “triggers.” That’s because they trigger, or turn on, cigarette cravings. Breaking these habits is the hardest part of quitting for some smokers.</p>
								
						<h2>Before you quit, take these five important steps:</h2>
								<p>S = Set a quit date.
T = Tell family, friends, and co-workers that you plan to quit.
A = Anticipate and plan for the challenges you’ll face while quitting.
R = Remove cigarettes and other tobacco products from your home, car, and work.
T = Talk to your doctor about getting help to quit.</p>
								<h2>Did You Know?</h2>
								<p>Your body gets more than nicotine when you smoke.
There are more than 4,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke. Some of them are also in wood varnish, the insect poison DDT, arsenic, nail polish remover, and rat poison.
The soot, tar, gases, and other poisons in cigarettes harm your body over time. They damage your heart and lungs. They also make it harder for you to taste, smell, and fight infections.</p>
